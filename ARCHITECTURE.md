# rho architecture

`rho` is a Rust-local toolkit for building AI agents by composing crates rather
than by running a supervisor, extension protocol, or daemon process graph.

## Crate layering

- `rho-core` owns the shared vocabulary: transcript items, inference requests,
  inference events and responses, tool calls/results, usage, roles, message
  phases, and opaque provider items. It should stay policy-light.
- Inference crates, currently `rho-inference`, translate `rho-core` inference
  requests into provider-specific wire protocols and translate provider events
  back into `rho-core` items and updates.
- `rho-agent` owns the opinionated harness policy: queueing, retries/tool
  scheduling, streamed transcript handling, inference response block recording,
  and persistence hooks. It depends directly on the concrete `rho-inference`
  session.
- `rho-context-config` owns bounded `AGENTS.md` loading plus local Markdown
  skill discovery/frontmatter parsing. Results are cached per
  `rho-workspaces::Workspace`; `rho-agent` owns system prompt rendering.
  Clients have no special skill or AGENTS.md command path.
- CLI and UI crates assemble concrete providers, tools, stores, and terminal
  rendering. They should not own inference protocol details.
- `rho-voice` is a provider-protocol crate outside the inference contract: it
  speaks the xAI realtime voice WebSocket (audio streams, voice tool calls)
  and deliberately never touches `rho-core` transcript vocabulary. Voice is a
  control surface over agents, assembled by the daemon, not an inference
  provider.
- Store crates own concrete persistence formats. Tool crates own concrete tool
  execution.
- `rho-code-mode` is a tool crate: it runs model-authored JavaScript in an
  in-process V8 isolate (deno_core) and exposes the `exec`/`wait` tool pair.
  Nested tool calls made by scripts leave the crate through a `ToolDispatcher`
  trait implemented by the assembling harness; the crate depends only on
  `rho-core` vocabulary.

Claude Code MCP support follows the same boundary: `rho-claude` knows how to
set per-agent MCP environment, but the MCP server that exposes Rho multi-agent
operations lives at the CLI/daemon control boundary. Claude Code can launch a
globally configured `rho mcp-agent-tools` stdio MCP server; that server reads
`RHO_MCP_AGENT_ID` from the Claude process environment, relays tool calls to the
daemon, and the daemon executes parent-scoped spawn, agent mail, interrupt, and
wait against `AgentPool`. The MCP server must not reach into `rho-core` or
provider crates.

`rho-slack` is the in-process Slack surface. `SlackManager` is handed the
daemon's `AgentPool` and `RhoDb` and owns everything Slack: sealed-memfd
secret storage (`SecretStore`), the Socket Mode reconnect loop, mapping each
Slack thread to an agent session persisted in rho-db, and posting each
turn's final answer back to the thread. The daemon only installs secrets
into it and resumes it from the systemd fd store on startup.

Dependencies should flow from higher-level assembly/policy crates toward lower
reusable crates. The shared `rho-core` crate must not depend on provider, agent,
store, tool, or CLI crates.

## Transcript and inference data ownership

`rho_core::ItemBlock` is the transcript unit passed between stores, agents, and
providers.

- `ItemBlock::Local` is local/user/tool/agent-owned transcript data.
- `ItemBlock::InferenceResponse` is provider-owned output plus the optional
  provider response id needed for provider-side chaining.
- Provider-specific data that must be replayed but is not part of the shared
  semantic vocabulary is carried as `rho_core::ProviderItem` with an opaque JSON
  payload and a coarse `ProviderItemKind`.

`rho-agent` is the canonical owner of the in-memory transcript during an agent
run and decides when to persist blocks. Inference crates may derive requests from
the transcript but should not mutate it directly.
