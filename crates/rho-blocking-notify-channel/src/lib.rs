//! A coalescing notify channel with multiple senders and a single receiver.
//!
//! The shared state is conceptually a single `bool`. Senders set it to `true`;
//! the receiver blocks until it becomes `true`, then atomically resets it to
//! `false`. Multiple sends before a receive coalesce into one notification.
//!
//! When every `Sender` has been dropped the channel becomes *disconnected*.
//! A pending notification always takes priority over disconnection: the
//! receiver will see `Ok(())` first and only get `Err(Disconnected)` on the
//! next call. Dropping the receiver is not observable by senders; later
//! notifications still set the coalesced bit and return normally.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```rust
//! let (tx, rx) = rho_blocking_notify_channel::channel();
//!
//! tx.notify();
//! assert_eq!(rx.recv(), Ok(()));
//! assert_eq!(
//!     rx.try_recv(),
//!     Ok(rho_blocking_notify_channel::TryRecvStatus::Empty)
//! );
//!
//! drop(tx);
//! assert!(rx.recv().is_err());
//! ```
//!
//! # Why a custom primitive
//!
//! `std::sync::mpsc::channel::<()>()` would require the receiver to drain the
//! queue on each wakeup to preserve coalescing, and the queue would grow
//! unboundedly under burst load. A `parking_lot::Condvar` would remove the
//! poisoning boilerplate but is not currently a workspace dependency. This
//! crate's contract — single coalesced bit, multi-producer, blocking receive,
//! observable disconnect — is small enough that a direct `Mutex` + `Condvar`
//! implementation is the simplest fit.
